### About Me

Hi! I'm Tomas. This is my blog.

Here I will blog on topics that interest me professionally. What interests me are systems. Both digital systems composed of software and hardware and analogue systems composed of people. Most interesting are systems composed of both software and people. These are the most complex, but also the most rewarding to work with.

My writing will probably revolve heavily around software, agile methods, embedded systems, machine learning, complexity theory, leadership and everything in between.

The reason I blog is as much to clarify my own thinking as it is to share my thoughts with you. 

I hope you find it interesting!
